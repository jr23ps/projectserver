            <p>
                Chimpanzees are intelligent, social primates found in African rainforests and savannahs. They share about 98% of their DNA with humans, making them one of our closest living relatives.
                These highly sociable animals live in complex groups and use tools, exhibit emotional behaviors, and have intricate social relationships.
